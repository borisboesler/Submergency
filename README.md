# Submergency

Submergency: view and export your submerge data stored in your
HeathKit.

Submergency imports your submerge data stored in your iPhone's
HealthKit and reorganizes them as *dive sessions*.  The break between
two dive sessions can be configured.  You can view a dive session
as a chart and export it in [UDDF
format](https://www.streit.cc/resources/UDDF/v3.2.3/en/index.html).
